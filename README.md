# Software Engineer Information Hub

ðŸš€ **Embarking on My Website Development Journey**

I started learning how to create websites from the very basics, including:

- **HTML** (Hypertext Markup Language): Understanding how to structure a webpage, create paragraphs, headings, images, and hyperlinks.

## Project Overview

This project is a **simple information website** aimed at providing beginners with fundamental knowledge for learning software engineering. The website includes:

- **Basic Website Structure**: Using HTML to build the websiteâ€™s framework, including headings, paragraphs, images, tables, and links.

## Features

- **Information Page**: Introduces key areas of software engineering, including programming fundamentals, data structures and algorithms, and system design.
- **Resource Links**: Provides links to learn HTML and access programming books.
- **Table Overview**: Displays essential information about software engineering roles, salary, and commonly used tools.
- **Favicon**: Implements a small icon (`favicon.ico`) to enhance the website's branding and user experience.

## Learning Reflection

Through this project, I learned how to use HTML to build a website's basic structure. This is my first step into web development, and I look forward to adding more features, such as JavaScript, to make the website more interactive and dynamic in the future.
